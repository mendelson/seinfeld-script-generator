# seinfeld-script-generator
A script generator based on the "Seinfeld" TV show using LSTM. This project is based on the Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree RNN Project.

## Project Overview

This project takes as input a dataset with scripts from the "Seinfeld" TV Show from Kaggle and uses it to train an RNN to build new fake sripts.

Check the `script_generator.ipynb` notebook for more instructions on how to generate new scripts.

## Example Output

The following 400-word script is a sample generated script:
